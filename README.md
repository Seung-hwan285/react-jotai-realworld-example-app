![Vanilla Js + Functional components + history API](logo_js.png)


This project is solely a side project that I work on during my free time. I initiated this project with the purpose of providing a resource for individuals interested in exploring vanilla JavaScript before transitioning to frameworks/libraries. Additionally,

it functions as a platform for testing different JavaScript libraries. Please refrain from sending threatening emails from unknown email addresses.

I have absolutely no aversion to frameworks/libraries. Normally, I develop using a framework, but since this project is my personal endeavor, I opted to utilize JavaScript without relying on a framework.

Also, if you have something to say, please post it in the discussion. I am open to hearing your opinions.

I like using both JS/TS and I don't want to obscure which language is better.
Please do not send speculative emails about me

> ### Vanilla Js + Functional Components + history API real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld-example-apps) spec and API.

### [Demo](https://js-playground-two.vercel.app)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **Vanilla Js + Functional Components + history API + Vite** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

This is still an unfinished project.


## Getting Started

You can't view a live demo over at [Demo](https://js-playground-two.vercel.app)
